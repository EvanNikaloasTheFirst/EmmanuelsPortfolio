# EmmanuelsPortfolio

I created a portfolio website for athlete and chose to diversify the method i used to create this website.
Previously I use the grid-template-method I was taught in my first year Web development class in University 
and found that the website tended to look quite static and basic. After researching many websites over the internet I took great inspiration from Marcus
Rashford's Personal portfolio ( https://marcusrashfordofficial.com/ ) and thought it looked like what a website in 2022 should look like. Modern, unique and responsive.

I watched a online tutorial on how to create a single page website which provides all the information of the website all at once, saving time for the data to load.
This website was formed via strictly HTML,CSS & a little bit of JavaScript.

Here I reacted the formation for the different section of the web page using an array of 'Section' tags.

To itterate through the page you can click on the nav links in the menu(mobile) / top of the screen (desktop), although I currently have a bug where when i click on the hamburger icon to remove the nav bar from screen, it takes the user back to the top of the website which is undesireable.

*Bug still present
